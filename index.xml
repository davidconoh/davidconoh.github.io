      <description>Not long ago, I started fiddling with my computer and now I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop surfing the internet for every bit of assistance I can get when I finally break something or just looking to find a new tool to play with.
And&amp;hellip; Heck! I also do really fancy those tech-related updates with the most recent intel on what&amp;rsquo;s truly out there now, what&amp;rsquo;s coming next, and what&amp;rsquo;s not doing very great at the moment so I can always easily employ the coolest trends in hacking my everyday digital adventure.</description>

      <description>Hugo has figure shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:
https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:
 big: images will break the width limit of main content area. left: images will float to the left. right: images will float to the right.  If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: !</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
