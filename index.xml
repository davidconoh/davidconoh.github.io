      <description>Exploring cool tech, learning together and helping each other out with bug fixes or new features&amp;hellip; What&amp;rsquo;s your unicorn formular for being worldclass?
Our approach to redefining the digital making experience in our beloved city, Aba, Nigeria, involves exploring the amazing capabilities of inexpensive maker tools like the Raspberry Pi computer and Arduino microcontroller, leveraging on free and accessible digital learning resources to supercharge our learning adventure. Through this drive, we hope to model an open and inclusive environment that inspires a new generation of hobbyists, tinkerers, hackers and inventors to learn together and support each other in building such amazing projects that we can share with the maker community and the world in general.</description>

      <description>Not long ago, I started fiddling with my computer and now I can’t seem to stop surfing the web for every bit of assistance I can get when I finally break something and need a fix, or just looking to find a new tool to play with.
Even now, I keep digging the internet for updates on the most recent intel on what’s truly out there now, what’s coming soon, and what might not be scoring the big leap into tomorrow so I can always easily employ the coolest trends in dabbling through my everyday digital adventure.</description>
