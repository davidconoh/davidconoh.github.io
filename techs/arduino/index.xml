      <description>Exploring cool tech, learning together and helping each other out with bug fixes or new features&amp;hellip; What&amp;rsquo;s your unicorn formular for being worldclass?
Our approach to redefining the digital making experience at the local scene involves the exploration of amazing developer tools as well as open learning resources crafted and vetted by makers world-wide to supercharge our learning adventure. Through this drive, we hope to model an open and inclusive environment that inspires a new generation of hobbyists, tinkerers, hackers and inventors to keep learning together and to support each other in building amazing projects that they will always be proud to share with the global maker community and the world in general.</description>
